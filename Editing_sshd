# In the above: 
              #Match Group External- This indicates the next lines will only be matched for users who belong to Internal and External groups. 
              #ChrootDirectory /Shared/%u - This is the path that will be used for chroot after the user is authenticated.%u indicates the user. So for User2, this will be /Shared/User2.
              #ForceCommand internal-sftp- this forces the execution of the internal-sftp and ignores any commands that are mentioned in the /ssh/rc file.
              #service sshd restart - restarts the ssh service so that the changed settings can pick up.
