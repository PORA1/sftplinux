# from a priviledged or root account modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.

      vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
#Comment out the following line by adding # symbol before it. 

    #Subsystem    sftp   /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server 

#Next add the following line to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

    Subsystem  sftp    internal-sftp

#Save the changes and verify the changes by below command:

  grep sftp /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

#You want to restrict the groups on the chroot jail environment.

  tail /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  Match Group Internal
  ChrootDirectory /Shared
  ForceCommand internal-sftp

tail /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  Match Group External
  ChrootDirectory /Shared
  ForceCommand internal-sftp

# In the above: 
              #Match Group Internal and External- This indicates the next lines will only be matched for users who belong to Internal and External groups. 
              #ChrootDirectory /Shared- This is the path that will be used for chroot after the user has successfully connected via sftp. 
              @ForceCommand internal-sftp- this forces the execution of the internal-sftp and ignores any command that are mentioned in the /ssh/rc file.
