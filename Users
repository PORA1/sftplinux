#Below we create  or edit existing users from a privileged or root account. The users should be restricted to a controlled (chroot) environment and should not be allowed to perform ssh (login) to the server. 
# As per our scenario we need two users one belonging to the Internal group and the other to the External group. 
# The below command creates user1, assigns the user to an Internal group, makes shared their home directory and set sbin/nologin as shell(which will not allow the user to ssh and get shell access. The second command passwd allows the setting up of the user password. 

    useradd -g  Internal -d  /Shared -s /sbin/nologin user1
    passwd user1

# The below command creates user2, assigns the user to an External  group, makes shared their home directory and set sbin/nologin as shell(which will not allow the user to ssh and get shell access. 

    useradd -g  Internal -d  /Shared -s /sbin/nologin user2
    passwd user2

#Verify that the users got created properly by below command.
    grep user1 /etc/passwd
    user1:x:1061:1061::/Shared:/sbin/nologin 

#change the command above to user 2 to verify that the user was created correctly. The number 1061 on the user details above might be different on your system. This should not raise alarm.
